            These settings are optional but allow you to specify a range of

            will ensure that only cells within this scope range are allowed to
            be processed. You may choose to use a scope range if there are some
            cells in the sheet that may not need to be processed, for example,
            detection limit specifications that sit in a certain area of the
            sheet.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            To enter a scope range, you must set the starting and ending cell

            addresses as standard cell addresses but in lowercase such as
            &quot;a3&quot; or &quot;d13&quot;. Note that column addresses are

            The Under Limit settings are used to define which cells will be
            treated as an Under Limit case and how to transform such cells.
            Required settings are the &quot;Trigger Character&quot; and
            &quot;Transform Function&quot; settings.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            The &quot;Trigger Character&quot; setting allows you to input a
            character or line of text that matches the detection limit notation
            in your data sheet. Most labs will use a &quot;&lt;&quot; character
            to denote that a value is less than a minimum detection limit, while
            others are known to use a &quot;&minus;&quot; character. In addition
            to these characters, this setting allows you to enter a custom
            string of text in case your lab results use differing notation.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            To input your trigger character or text string, enter your
            case&ndash;sensitive text into the setting input. To allow
            flexibility, this setting accepts all standard punctuation and
            letter characters without spaces.
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            The &quot;Transform Function&quot; setting is where you set how you
            want to transform any instances of Under Limit values that the app
            finds. There are four options to choose from&#58;
          </Typography>
          <ol className={classes.GuideContent_functionList}>
            <li className={classes.GuideContent_functionListItem}>

            <li className={classes.GuideContent_functionListItem}>
              <strong>Halve&#58;</strong> divides the detection limit value by 2
              while keeping significant figures intact.
            </li>
            <li className={classes.GuideContent_functionListItem}>
              <strong>Zero&#58;</strong> changes any detection limit value into
              a 0&ndash;number value.
            </li>
            <li className={classes.GuideContent_functionListItem}>
              <strong>No transform&#58;</strong> does nothing to a detection
              limit value once found.

          </ol>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            Lastly, in the special case where your lab has included entries like
            &quot;null&quot;, &quot;void&quot;, &quot;zero&quot;,
            &quot;N/A&quot;, or other text values to represent a zero value, the
            &quot;Zero Trigger&quot; setting is included as a method to convert
            these values. This setting will accept any alpha text value and is
            case&ndash;sensitive. Cell values that match this trigger will be
            transformed to a 0&ndash;number value. This is an optional setting
            and will respect any specified Scope Range settings applied.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            For the Over Limit settings, the &quot;Trigger Character&quot;
            provides the same functionality as the Under Limit setting but will
            be used to search out Over Limit values. Again, this setting accepts
            standard punctuation and letters in a case&ndash;sensitive fashion.
            Spaces and numbers are not allowed. This is a required setting.
          </Typography>

            The Over Limit &quot;Tranform Function&quot; provides the same
